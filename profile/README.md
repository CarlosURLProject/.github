# Ojos Project

Welcome to the Ojos Project, a research project under the [Undergraduate Research Lab](https://markbaldw.in/url/) project at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu).

## About

The goal of the Ojos Project is to create a hospice care management system that empowers hospice patients and caregivers. This would be integrated into hardware that is used in a patient's home, and software that caregivers already use.

Any code written for this project will be open source.
