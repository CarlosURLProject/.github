# Carlos' URL Project

This is the organization I will be using for my [Undergraduate Research Lab](https://markbaldw.in/url/) project at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu). In this document I will outline the different repositories and their intended purpose, as well as a description of the project as a whole.

## Project

I will come up with a name soon.

I will be creating a hospice care management system that empowers family members of hospice patients help said patient. This would be integrated into hardware that would be used in a patient's home.

Any code written for this project will be open source.
